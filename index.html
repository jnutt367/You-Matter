	<h1>Purpose:</h1>
	<p>The application will provide resources to the users that steers them
	in the right direction to receive the help they need. Or, in emergency situations
	gives them a pipeline to an actual person and/or community to provide
	support in dealing with these things that no one was ever meant to go through alone
	anyways.</p>
	<h1>Features:</h1>
	<p>There will be a chat bot that interacts with the user that we have 
	programmed as many relevant questions that a person in a situations
	such as there's may have...</p>
	<h1>Resources:</h1>
	<p>We are in the process of looking the best resources that 
	we can, with wide ranges of help, to direct these men and women.
	It is our goal to provide every resource we can that we believe may help
	to improve and/or advance the person that seeks it a better way of life or at least a lifeline 
	of support to lean on until they can achieve this goal.</p>
