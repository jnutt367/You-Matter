	<h1>Mission:</h1>
	<p>The application will provide resources to the users that steers them
	in the right direction to receive the help they need. Or, in emergency situations
	gives them a pipeline to an actual person and/or community to provide
	support in dealing with these things that no one was ever meant to go through alone
	anyways.</p>
	<h1>Features:</h1>
	<p>There will be a chat bot that interacts with the user that we have 
	programmed as <br>many relevant questions that a person in a situations
	such as there's may have...</p>
	<p>What brings you to our site?</p>
	<p>Are you suffering from...?</p>
	<p>Do you need to talk with someone now?...</p>
	</main>
	<article class="article">
	<h1>Resources:</h1>
	<p>We are in the process of looking the best resources that 
	we can, with wide ranges of help, to direct these men and women.
	It is our goal to provide every resource we can that we believe may help
	to improve and/or advance the person that seeks it a better way of life or at least a lifeline 
	of support to lean on until they can achieve this goal.</p>

		<h1>A list of possible resources:</h1>
			<p>Websites with similar mission statements,</p>
			<p>Reading Material: articles, books and blogs.</p>
			<p>Interview demographic that we are trying to help.</p>
			<p>Use our own unique life experience, empathy and <br>understanding to incorporate
			the things that are most essential<br> for a path to peace and recovery of your spirit.</p>
			<p>Obviously all the courses we've taken to be able to build this thang!</p>
			<p>But those are our resources, not resources our users will need, but I digress.</p>
